#### RAID Calculations
- RAID 0
	- `total capacity = # of drives * smallest drive capacity`
- RAID 1
	- `total capacity = smallest drive capacity`
- RAID 5
	- `total capacity = (# of drives - 1) * smallest drive capacity`
- RAID 1+0
	- `total capacity = (# of drives / 2) * smallest drive capacity`
#### Fake RAID
- BIOS configured RAID
- does not have an actual RAID controller

#### CPU Sockets
- BGA
- PGA
- LGA

#### Memory
- sockets
	- DIMM
	- SODIMM

#### Expansion Slots
- PCI (peripheral component interconnect)
- PCI-X (peripheral component interconnect extended)
- AGP (accelerated graphics port)
- PCIe (peripheral component interconnect express)
- M.2 slots - next generation form factor (NGFF)

#### Chipset
- relays communication between the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices
- Intel uses PCH platform controller hub
- AMD uses FCH fusion controller hub
- **northbridge**
	- high speed components
	- RAM, GPU PCIe slot
- **southbridge**
	- I/O functions
	- USB, SATA, ethernet
#### BIOS & UEFI
- older motherboards use CMOS chip and battery
- newer motherboards use EEPROM (electronically erasable programable read only memory)

#### SATA
- serial advanced technology attachment
- supports hot swapping

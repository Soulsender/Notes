- pliers
- screwdriver (jewlers)

#### Multimeter
- some include voltmeter
> Some multimeters include a voltmeter feature. A voltmeter is an instrument you can use for measuring electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale to show the voltage of the circuit. Digital voltmeters display a numerical value of the voltage by using an analog-to-digital converter.
- electronic measuring instruments
- tests:
	- resistance
	- current flow
	- some test capacitance (ability to hold charge)
	- simple continuity (connection between cables)

#### Power Supply Tester
- version of a multimeter
- tests correct voltage
- designed to test DC power

#### Tone Generator and Probe
- traces wire from wall drop (RJ-45) to wiring closet
- emits tone as it goes along the wire

#### Cable Tester
- tests cables for continuity
- TDR (time domain reflectometry)
	- uses time domain reflectometry (wtf does this mean)
	- locates faults in wires & PCBs

#### Loopback Plug
- identifies network or NIC issues
- light goes on = means its good
- if data going out is same as going in then device works correctly

#### Known Good Spares
- spare equipment
- replace suspected bad equipment

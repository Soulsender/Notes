### Ingredients 
- Pasta (linguine or spaghetti is preferable)
- Pancetta (up to you how much you want usually like 50-100g per person)
- 1 or 2 Eggs
- Parmesan Reggiano (good parmesan is important)
### Steps
- Boil water for pasta.
- Cook da pancetta in a pan. It cooks very fast and can burn very easily. You want it crispy, it's similar to bacon.
- Cook the pasta. If you break it in half I will break your neck in half.
- Make the sauce by combining the eggs in a bowl with thinly shredded parmesan. It should be a little thick. Add some pepper as well. 
- Just before you drain the pasta, take a little bit of the pasta water and put it in the pan with the pancetta. Sounds weird, just do it. It will pop and be a little angy so be careful and only add a little. Mix it around with the pancetta.
- Drain the excess fat from the pancetta pan.
- IMPORTANT: you need to have the pan warm, but not actively on the flame. Take the pasta, put it in the pan with the pancetta, and add the egg sauce on top. Mix it around, it should be warm, but the egg should NOT scramble.
- Take it out of the pan when you are satisfied everything is warm enough. The egg sauce should coat the noodles nicely.
- Put it in a bowl, add parsley and extra parmesan if you want, and add pepper.
- Enjoy!

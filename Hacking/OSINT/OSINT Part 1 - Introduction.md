(PART 1: INTRO-TO: OSINT)

\~ To anyone who is new to OSINT, and is looking for an idea on what it is? why it is used? and how it is used? well Part 1 is for you. üòò . iv added more tools and change some things on this version. this is not my work. it is all the sites that have helped me with my projects. Part 1 is just a general overview. I have linked all the sources other than Wikipedia.

INTRO TO OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

**So What is OSINT?**

Open-source intelligence, or OSINT, is the collection and analysis of information that is gathered from public, or open, sources.

There is no specific date on when the term OSINT was first proposed; however, a relative term has probably been used for hundreds of years to describe the act of gathering intelligence through exploiting publicly available resources.

In recent history, OSINT was introduced during World War II as an intelligence tool by many nations security agencies, however, with the explosive growth of the internet communications and the huge volume of digital data produced by the public worldwide, OSINT gathering becomes a necessity for different organizations, for instance, government departments, nongovernmental organization, (NGO) organizations, and business corporations are starting to rely to a large extent on OSINT rather than private and classified information.

OSINT sources are distinguished from other forms of intelligence because they must be legally accessible by the public without breaching any copyright or privacy laws. This distinction makes the ability to gather OSINT sources applicable to more than just security services. For example, businesses can benefit from exploiting these resources to gain intelligence about their competitors.

=== How is OSINT used by investigators and law enforcement?

OSINT includes all publicly accessible sources of information. This information can be found either online or offline: The Internet, which includes the following and more: forums, blogs, social networking sites, video-sharing sites like [YouTube.com](https://youtube.com/), wikis, Whois records of registered domain names, metadata and digital files, dark web resources, geolocation data, IP addresses, people search engines and anything that can be found online. Traditional mass media (e.g., television, radio, newspapers, books, magazines).

Specialized journals, academic publications, dissertations, conference proceedings, company profiles, annual reports, company news, employee profiles, and r√©sum√©s. Photos and videos including metadata. Geo-spatial information (e.g., maps and commercial imagery products)

==== Why is OSINT Valuable for an investigation?

\--- OSINT is valuable because it has less rigorous processing and exploitation processes and timelines than more technical intelligence disciplines such as HUMINT, SIGINT, MASINT, GEOINT, etc. Additionally, OSINT collects a valuable variety of opinions because it encompasses a great variety of sources.

Open-source information provides a base for understanding classified materials. Despite large quantities of classified material produced by the IC, (Intel community) the amount of classified information produced on any one topic can be quite limited and may be taken out of context if viewed only from a classified-source perspective. A notable example relates to terrorism, where open-source information can fill gaps and create links that allow analysts to better understand fragmented intelligence, rumored terrorist plans, possible means of attack, and potential targets.

Open-source materials can protect sources and methods. Sometimes an intelligence judgment that is actually informed with sensitive, classified information can be defended on the basis of open-source reporting. This can prove useful when policy-makers need to explain policy decisions or communicate with foreign officials without compromising classified sources.

Only open source can store history. A robust open-source program can, in effect, gather data to monitor the world's cultures and how they change with time. This is difficult, if not impossible, using the snapshots provided by classified collection methods.

Advanced data analytics have changed how public safety agencies leverage data to solve crimes. On the flip side, these agencies are overwhelmed with continuously growing mountains of data. While data-driven policing is on the rise, law enforcement officers have yet to realize the full benefits of situational awareness that helps them differentiate the signal from the noise.

== Phases of the OSINT Process;

====== OSINT is usually performed during the Reconnaissance phase of hacking and pertinent information collected from this phase is carried over into the network Enumeration phase. Due to the vast amounts of information available to sift through on the Web, attackers must have a clear and defined search framework as well as a wide array of OSINT collection tools to facilitate this task and assist with processing the data; otherwise, they risk getting lost in the overwhelming sea of information that has become the Internet. OSINT reconnaissance can be further broken down into the following 5 sub-phases:

1 - **Source Identification**: - As the starting point, in this initial phase the attacker identifies potential sources from which information may be gathered from. Sources are internally documented throughout the process in detailed notes to come back to later if necessary.

2 - **Data Harvesting**: - In this phase, the attacker collects and harvests information from the selected sources and other sources that are discovered throughout this phase.

3 - **Data Processing and Integration: -** During this phase, the attacker processes the harvested information for actionable intelligence by searching for information that may assist in the investigation

4 - **Data Analysis: -** In this phase, the attacker performs data analysis of the processed information using OSINT analysis tools.

5 - R**esults Delivery: -** In the final phase, OSINT analysis is complete and the findings are presented/reported to other members of the red Team.

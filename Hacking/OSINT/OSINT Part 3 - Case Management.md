An intelligence collection plan [ICP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_collection_plan) is the systematic process used by most modern armed forces and intelligence services to meet intelligence requirements through the tasking of all available resources to gather and provide pertinent information within a required time limit. Creating a collection plan is part of the intelligence cycle.

While an ICP has no prescribed doctrinal format, it must use all available collection capabilities to meet the decision maker's priority requirements. It must be precise and concise, yet a working document that is flexible enough to respond to changes as they occur.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_collection_plan#cite_note-FM342-2)

# Case Management

Organization is About Efficiency, and is key in reducing errors and clutter, saving time and money and Improving the over all quality of the results.

Despite the large search outcome, experts would agree that there are no more than 20 or so definitions of case management considered appropriate. These definitions are available in peer-reviewed professional case management literature or on Web sites and in other formal documents of case management (or case management-related) organizations, societies, and government or non-government agencies. The Case Management Knowledge Framework

If you cant afford the Fancy-Pants case management software such as  [i-sight](https://i-sight.com/) / [Maltego](https://www.paterva.com/) .. No worries [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) Has u covered. [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is the only software that automatically senses research on the web. Need an article from  [Jstor](https://www.jstor.org/) or a [preprints](https://www.preprints.org/)  from [arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/) ? A news story from the New York Times or a book from a library? Zotero has you covered, everywhere.

[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) helps you organize your research any way you want. You can sort items into collections and tag them with keywords. Or create saved searches that automatically fill with relevant materials as you work.

# OSINT Browser's for case management

1. **Name:** [Oryon](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oryon-osint-browser/files/latest/download) (Free) Oryon C Portable is a web browser designed to assist researchers in conducting Open Source Intelligence investigations. Oryon comes with dozens of pre-installed tools and a select set of links cataloged by category - including those that can be found in the OI Shared Resources.
2. **Name:**  [OSIRT](https://cyber-cops.com/investigation-tools/welcome-to-osirt)  (Free)**URL:** [http://www.osirtbrowser.com/](http://www.osirtbrowser.com/)\*\*Description:\*\*This browser is customized especially for law enforcement authorities
3. **Name:**  [EPIC](https://www.epicbrowser.com/) (Free)                                                                                                                                                                            Epic blocks fingerprinting scripts and functions like image canvas data access to protect you which no browser extension can do. There is no combination of settings changes and browser addons which provides the same level of protection, let alone the ease and speed of use that Epic does. Unfortunately, any browser addon has access to your entire browsing and search history and while many may protect you from some trackers, they often collect and sell your data to others -- so browser addons may reduce your privacy and security rather than enhance it.

While there are a lot of OSINT techniques and mechanisms, not all of them will work for your target. First, you will have to ask yourself a couple of questions:

* What am I looking for?
* What is my main research goal?
* What or who is my target?
* How am I going to conduct my research?

Try to find the answer to these questions, and that will be the first step in your OSINT investigation.

While a lot of OSINT techniques are used by government and military agencies, they can often be applied to your own company, too. Some may work, others may not, but that's part of the OSINT strategy – you will have to identify which sources are good and which ones are irrelevant for your research.

Let's take a look into the most popular OSINT techniques used in cyber-security:

* Collect employee full names, job roles, as well as the software they use.
* Review and monitor search engine information from Google (especially using [Google Dorks](https://securitytrails.com/blog/google-hacking-techniques)), Bing, Yahoo, and others.
* Monitoring personal and corporate blogs, as well as review user activity on digital forums.
* Identify all social networks used by the target user or company.
* Review content available on social networks like Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus, or LinkedIn.
* Use people data collection tools like [Pipl](http://www.pipl.com/), who will help you to reveal a lot of information about individuals in one single place.
* Access old cached data from Google – often reveals interesting information.
* Exploring old versions of websites to reveal important information using sites like the [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/)
* Identify mobile phone numbers, as well as mail addresses from social networks, or Google results.
* Search for photographs and videos on common social photo sharing sites, such as Flickr, Google Photos, etc.
* Use Google Maps and other open satellite imagery sources to retrieve images of users' geographic location.
* Use tools like [GeoCreepy](https://www.geocreepy.com/) to track down geographic location information to have a clear picture of the users' current locations.
* Use automated OSINT tools to retrieve information, such as [Spiderfoot](https://securitytrails.com/blog/spiderfoot-osint-automation-tool) or [us](https://securitytrails.com/blog/phantom-app-integration).
* Use popular OSINT extensions that include useful sources like [OSINT Browser](http://www.osintbrowser.com/).
* Explore  [DNS](https://dnssec-debugger.verisignlabs.com/)  Services, as well as domains, [Sub-domains](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Discovery/DNS) , and IP addresses using our own [SecurityTrails toolkit](https://securitytrails.com/).
* Run [port scanners](https://securitytrails.com/blog/best-port-scanners) against the target company server infrastructure to find running services.
* Use tools to search for internet-connected devices like [Shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) used by your target.

These are some of the most popular techniques you will find. However, after you are done doing OSINT research, you will have a lot of data to analyze. That's when you will have to refine your results, and search in detail for all the really necessary things you need, and discard the rest.

***The classic OSINT methodology you will find everywhere is strait-forward:***

1. Define requirements: What are you looking for?
2. Retrieve data
3. Analyze the information gathered
4. Pivoting & Reporting: Either define new requirements by pivoting on data just gathered or end the investigation and write the report.

This methodology is pretty intuitive and may not help much, but I think it is still important to go back to it regularly, and take the time to make an iteration of the loop. Very often during investigations, we get lost into the amount of data gathered, and it is hard to have a view of what direction should the investigation take. In that case, I think it is helpful to take a break and go back to step 3 and 4: analyze and summarize what you have found, list what could help you pivoting and define new (or more precise) questions that still need answers.

***Keep Evidences***\*\*:\*\*

Information disappear online very quickly. Imagine you do a single opsec mistake, like clicking on a like on a tweet or the person you are researching start to be suspicious, suddenly all the social media accounts and websites can disappear from one day to the other. So keep evidences: screenshots, archives, web archives (more information later) or anything else that works for you.

***Timelines are good:***

in [Forensics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forensic_science),  timeline and pivoting on events happening in the same time is key. It is definitely not as important in OSINT but still a very interesting tool to organize your data. When was the website created? When was the Facebook account created? When was the last blog post done? Having all this in a table often give me a good view of what I am looking for.

Then there are two other methods I find useful. The first one are flowcharts to describe the workflow to search for more information based on a type of data (like an email). The best one I have seen are the one done by [Michael Bazzell](https://inteltechniques.com/) at [IntelTechniques.com](https://inteltechniques.com/). For instance here is Michael Bazzell workflow when researching information on an email address:

***Technical Infrastructure***

Analysis of the technical infrastructure is at the crossroad between threat intelligence and open source intelligence, but it is definitely an important part of investigations in some context.

# Here is what you should look for:

IP and domains: there are many different tools for that but I find Passive Total (now called [riskiq](https://www.riskiq.com/)) to be one of the best source of information. Free access gives you 15 query per day through the web interface and 15 through the API. I rely mostly on it but  [robtex](https://www.robtex.com/) ,  [hackertarget](https://hackertarget.com/) and [securitytrails](https://securitytrails.com/dns-trails) are other good options.

Certificates: Censys is a great tool, but the less known and less fancy [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/) is also a very good certificate transparency database

Scans: it is often useful to know what kind of services are running on an IP, you can do the scan yourself with  [nmap](https://nmap.org/), but you can also rely on platforms doing regular scan of all IPv4 addresses for you. The two main platforms are  [Censys](https://github.com/Censys)  and [shodan](https://www.shodan.io/), they both focus on different aspects (more [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things)  for  [shodan](https://www.shodan.io/) ,  [nmore](https://www.nmore.com/)   [TLS](https://wiki.wireshark.org/TLS) for [Censys](https://github.com/Censys)) so it is good to know and use both of them.  [binaryedge.io](https://www.binaryedge.io/)  is a pretty new alternative to them but that is quickly evolving. More recently a similar Chinese platform called Fofa has been launched. Another source of information is  [rapid7](https://www.rapid7.com/)  Open Data but you will have to download the scan files and do research on your own. Finally, I find historical information on IP addresses to be a goldmine to understand the evolution of a platform, Censys only provide this data through paid plans (available for free for academic researchers) but Shodan provides this directly through the IP which is great ! Check the command harpoon shodan ip -H IP to see what it gives (you will have to pay Shodan for a life account).

**Threat information:**

Even if not essential in OSINT, it is always interesting to check for malicious activities an a domain, IP or url. To do that, I mostly rely on  [passivetotal](https://www.riskiq.com/products/passivetotal/)  OSINT and projects and on  [otx.alienvault](https://otx.alienvault.com/)

**Sub-domains:**

There are many different ways to find a list of [Subdomain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subdomain) for a domain, from Google search (site:DOMAIN) to searching in alternate domains in certificates. [passive-tool](https://community.riskiq.com/)  and  [binaryedge](https://www.binaryedge.io/)  implement this feature directly, so you can just query them to have a first list.

**Google analytics and social media:**

The last information that is really interesting, is to check if the same Google Analytics / Ad-sense id is used in several website. This technique was discovered in 2015 and well described here by  [bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/) . To look for these connections, I mostly use Passive Total,  [http://spyonweb.com/](http://spyonweb.com/) and [NerdyData](https://www.ilovefreesoftware.com/04/webware/nerdydata-search-engine-to-search-download-source-code.html).

**I hope this Helps New Researchers Good Luck.**

# Packing Malware

- Compression/encryption to make malware look different from source
- Sort of like a .zip 
- UPX - popular packing program
- Helps hide code from antiviruses
- Unpacked malware can have human-readable strings
- IMPORT Address Table will be much smaller if packed

### Packing Stub / Compression Stub \ Coder Stub
- Takes code all the code below certain point and crunches down
- Resulting program looks a lot smaller

### Why?
- Antivirus might skip over it because compressed code looks different to regular code

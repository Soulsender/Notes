## Scanning & Enumeration
- Nmap
- Nessus
- Nikto
- Research possible vulnerbilities

## Gaining Access (Exploitation)
- Running exploits against the client/machine/network
- Scanning a enumeration again

## Maintaining Access
- What if the client shuts off the server?

## Covering Tracks (Cleaning Up)

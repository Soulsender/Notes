- isotropic antenna is **hypothetical** point source where radiation is same in all directions
### Polarity
- waves changing angles
- polarity can change via atmosphere
- circular polarity is when waves transmitted vertically and horizontal
> ground waves do not change polarization (leaves antenna vertically, returns vertically)
### Antenna Length
- full wave above 30MHz
	- wavelength (meters) = 300 / frequency MHz
- full wave below 30MHz
	- wavelength (meters) = 286 / frequency MHz
### Antenna Calculations
- below 30 MHz
	- wavelength (meters) = 286 / frequency MHz
	- 1/2 wavelength (meters) = 143 / frequency MHz
> if you made a half-wave dipole antenna for 28.150 MHz, how long would it be?
> 143 / 28.150 = 5.08m
### Yagi
- increase gain by adding boom length and directors
- excellent front to back ratio
> yagi antennas have one driven element

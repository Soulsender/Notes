- isotropic antenna is **hypothetical** point source where radiation is same in all directions
### Polarity
- waves changing angles
- polarity can change via atmosphere
- circular polarity is when waves transmitted vertically and horizontal
> ground waves do not change polarization (leaves antenna vertically, returns vertically)

### Coaxial
- RG-213 best TL
- coaxial is weatherproof
- good with metal objects
### Parallel
- bad with metal objects
### Harmonics
- node is point where waves reflect
- 6th harmonic is 6x fundamental frequency
### Standing Wave Ratio (SWR)
- reflected power
- lower SWR is better
	- open or shorted connection is bad
- jumpy reading could mean bad electrical connection
### Other
> transmission line best suited operating at high SWR is 600 ohm open wire

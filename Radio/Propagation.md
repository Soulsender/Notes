"How radio waves travel through space."
- absorption occurs
- objects get in the way (buildings, mountains, etc.)
- **ionosphere** - effected by solar winds
- **ionosphere wave** (skip, sky-wave)
- **line of sight** (direct wave, direct path) - literally what it sounds like
- **surface wave** (ground wave) - follows curve of earth
- satilite comms must be commed to by higher frequency waves so they do not 
### Good & Bad Conditions

| Good                                            | Bad                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Sun is out, ionosphere is good (F, E, D layers) | Rain can block radio waves                  |
|                                                 | Night looses D layer, E layer is diminished |

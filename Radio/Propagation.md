"How radio waves travel through space."
- absorption occurs
- objects get in the way (buildings, mountains, etc.)
- **ionosphere** - effected by solar winds
- **ionosphere wave** (skip, sky-wave)
- **line of sight** (direct wave, direct path) - literally what it sounds like
- **surface wave** (ground wave) - follows curve of earth
- satellite comms must be higher frequency waves so they do not reflect on ionosphere
- 15 degrees best for longest distance generally
- skips bounce better over water
- lower freqs travel longer distances than higher

| Name             | Description                                                                                                               |

| Skip distance    | transmitter to nearest point where sky wave returns to eath. Determined by height of ionosphere & angle of waves          |
| Skip zone        | Point where no waves will reach (too close to groundwave, too far from skywave)                                           |
| Multihop         | Can reflect again and cause multihop where waves reflect multiple times (3000km per hop)                                  |
| Path loss        | Waves diminishing over time                                                                                               |
| Multipath        | Waves getting somewhere simultaneously by bouncing or travelling directly                                                 |
| Polarization     | VHF and UHF band antennas must have same polarization as transmitting/receiving **(not caused by parabolic interaction)** |
| Selective fading | phase differences between radio wave components of same transmission                                                      |

### Good & Bad Conditions
- Rain can block radio waves
- Night looses D layer, E layer is diminished, night is better for long range comms
- Sun is out, ionosphere is lower (F, E, D layers), better for short comms
### Ionosphere Layers
- `F > E > D` *(highest to lowest)*
- F layer hangs around
- splits into two (F1 and F2) at daytime
### Solar Activity
- 11-year solar cycle
- coronal mass ejection (CMEs)
	- can shut down electronics
	- influences all radio comms beyond ground way or line of sight
- more sun spots, greater ionization

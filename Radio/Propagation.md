"How radio waves travel through space."
- absorption occurs
- objects get in the way (buildings, mountains, etc.)
- **ionosphere** - effected by solar winds
- **ionosphere wave** (skip, sky-wave)
- **line of sight** (direct wave, direct path) - literally what it sounds like
- **surface wave** (ground wave) - follows curve of earth
- satellite comms must be higher frequency waves so they do not reflect on ionosphere
### Good & Bad Conditions
- Rain can block radio waves
- Night looses D layer, E layer is diminished, night is better for long range comms
- Sun is out, ionosphere is lower (F, E, D layers), better for short comms
### Ionosphere Layers
- `F > E > D` *(highest to lowest)*
- F layer hangs around
- splits into two (F1 and F2) at daytime

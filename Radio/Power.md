- **current (amps; I)** is measure of electrons
- **voltage (E or V)** is electrical pressure
- **resistance** (ohms; R)
```
  V
 ---
I x R
```
- double the resistance, half the current
- double the current, double the voltage
### Watts (P or W)
- rate of electricity use
- `W = E^2 / R`
### Magnetics
- opposite poles attract, like pole repel
- greater the current, greater than the magnetic field
- resistors lower voltage
### Battery
- common primary cell is carbon-zinc
- car battery lead-acid battery, 12 volts

### Human Hearing
- 20-20000 Hz
### Decibals
- +3 dB double
- -3 dB half
### Capacitors (Farads F)
- store energy
- smooth variable flows
- opposes changes in **voltage**
### Inductors
- opposes changes in **current**
- stores electrical energy as a magnetic field
- add inductors together in series 
### AC
- capacitive reactance
- resistance + reactance = impedance
### DC
- resistance
### Resonance
- adding circuit resistance does not change resonance
- resonanting frequency is how much the circuit oscillates

- **current (amps; I)** is measure of electrons
- **voltage (E or V)** is electrical pressure
- **resistance** (ohms; R)
```
  V
 ---
I x R
```
- double the resistance, half the current
- double the current, double the voltage
### Magnetics
- opposite poles attract, like pole repel
- greater the current, greater than the magnetic field
- resistors lower voltage

- default serial 1.544 mbps
- DLCL uses frame relay layer 2
- **ATM** - 53 bytes, transferring voice, video, and data built on cell-based arcitecture
### Terminology
- **data terminal equipment (DTE)** - device that connects subscriber LANs to WAN device (ie. router)
- **data communication equipment (DCE)** - used to communicate with provider (ie. modem)
- **customer premises equipment (CPE)** - DTE and DCE devices on enterprise edge, customer owns or leases the CPE from the provider
- **point-of-presence (POP)** - point where subscriber connects to service provider network
- **demarcation point** - physical location that separates CPE from service provider equipment
- **local loop** - actual copper or fiber cable that connects CPE to CO
- **central office (CO)** - local service provider facility that connects CPE to provider network
### Devices
- **voiceband modem** - uses telephone lines (legacy)
- **DSL/Cable modem** - broadband modems, connect to DTE router with ethernet
- **CSU/DSU** - connects digital to digital, can be separate device or interface
- **optical converter** - fiber optic converter
- **wireless router/access point** - wirelessly connect to WAN provider, can use cellular
- **core devices** - high speed routers and layer 3 switches
### Optical Fiber Layer 1 Standards
- **Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)** - global standard for transporting data over fiber optic
- **Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET)** - north american standard that provides same services as SDH
- **Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM)** - newer technology that increases data carrying capacity by using different wavelengths of light
### Cable Technology
- **Cable Modem Termination System (CMTS)** - communicates with cable modems

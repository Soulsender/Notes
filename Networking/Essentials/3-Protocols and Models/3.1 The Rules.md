#### Protocol Requirements
- Message encoding
- Message formatting and encapsulation
- Message size
- Message timing
- Message delivery options

#### Encoding
- messages turned into bits
- bits are encoded into voltage, light, microwaves

#### Size
- data is broken down to make it easier to receive

#### Timing
- flow control
	- managing the rate of data transmission
	- how much info can be sent 
- timeout
	- specifies how long the message is valid to be received
- access method
	- when a message can be sent

#### Network
- **Unicast**
	- information is being transmitted to only one device
- **Multicast**
	- multiple devices are receiving the message
- **Broadcast**
	- all devices are receiving the message

- **half duplex**
	- device cannot simultaneously transmit and receive
	- WLANs use this
- **full duplex**
	- both devices can transmit and receive at the same time

#### Access Control Methods
- contention based access
	- all nodes operating in half duplex
	- includes
		- wireless LAN
		- legacy bus-topology ethernet LAN
		- legacy ethernet LAN using hub
- controlled based access
	- each node has its own time to use the medium
- CSMA/CD (collision detection)
	- used in legacy bus ethernet LANs
	- MAC method
- CSMA/CA (collision avoidance)
	- used on wireless LANs
	- carrier sensing is used, but devices attempt to avoid collisions by sensing when channel is idle
	- nodes transmit packet data in entirety
	- devices will transmit a time duration so other devices know not to interrupt

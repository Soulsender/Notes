- ethernet works at both layer 2 and 1
#### Bandwidth 
- 10 Mbps
- 100 Mbps
- 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps)
- 10,000 Mbps (10 Gbps)
- 100,000 Mbps (100 Gbps)
#### Sublayers
- LLC - communicates between software and hardware
- MAC - responsible for data encapsulation
#### Frame Fields
- ethernet frames must be within 64-1518 bytes
- <64 bytes is a "collision fragment" or "runt frame"
- >1500 bytes is "jumbo" or "baby giant"
- if not within byte range, frame is dropped
- **preamble and start frame delimiter** - used for syncing between sending and receiving devices. used to get attention of receiving nodes
- **destination MAC** - identifier for intended recipient. can be unicast, multicast, or broadcast
- **source MAC** - source mac
- **type/length/ethertype** - identifies the protocol
	- `0x800` for IPv4
	- `0x86DD` for IPv6
	- `0x806` for ARP
- **data field** - encapsulated data from higher layer (generic layer 3 PDU or commonly IPv4). used as padding if frame is <64 bytes
- **frame check sequence (FCS)** - used as error detection. cyclic redundancy check (CRC).  sending device includes results of a CRC in the FCS. receiving device receives the frame; generates CRC to look for errors. basically a checksum.

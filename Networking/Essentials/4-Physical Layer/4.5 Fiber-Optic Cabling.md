- flexible
- uses light
- classified into two types
	- single-mode fiber (SMF)
	- multimode fiber (MMF)
	- dispersion differs between types
		- dispersion is the spreading out of a light pulse over time
		- more dispersion = more signal strength loss
		- MMF has higher dispersion than SMF
		- MMF has limited range
#### Single-Mode Fiber
- uses expensive laser tech
- consists of a small core
- popular in long-distance situations
- lower dispersion than MMF

#### Multimode Fiber
- larger core
- LED emitters
- light enters at different angles
- popular in LAN because LEDs are cheaper
- provides bandwidth up to 10 Gbps over link lengths of up to 550 meters
- higher dispersion

#### Usage
- enterprise networks 
- fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) - used to provide fiber to your home
- long-haul networks - used to connect countries and cities
- submarine cable networks - used to connect underwater and in harsh conditions

#### Fiber-Optic Connectors
- terminates end of optical fiber
- **straight tip connect (ST)**
	- locks securely with twist on/off bayonet
	- one of the first cables used
	- one cable only goes one direction so you might need two

- **subscriber connector (SC)**
	- aka "square connectors" or "standard connectors"
	- widely adopted LAN and WAN connector
	- multimode and single mode fiber

- **lucent connector (LC)**
	- smaller version of SC
	- aka "local connectors"
	- growing in popularity

- duplex multimode LC connector is similar to LC simplex connector but uses duplex connector

#### Fiber Patch Cords
- **SC-SC multimode patch cord**
	- required for interconnecting devices
	- colour shows single mode or multimode patch cords

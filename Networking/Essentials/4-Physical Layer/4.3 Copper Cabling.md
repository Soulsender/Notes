- most common type of cable
- is limited by distance and signal interference
- signals deteriorate over time (called signal attenuation)
- shielded by metallic materials to prevent interference
	- require grounding 

#### Interference
- EMI (electromagnetic interference) or RMI (radio frequency interference)
	- fluorescent lights
	- electric motors
	- radio waves
	- microwaves
- crosstalk
	- disturbance created by electric or magnetic fields of a signal on a wire

#### UTP Cabling
- most common 
- ends with RJ-45
- four pairs of colour-coded wires twisted together
- twisting helps prevent interference

#### Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)
- provide better noise protection than UTP cabling
- more expensive
- more difficult to install
- twisted wires
- terminated with special shielded STP data connectors
- if cable is improperly grounded, shield may act as an antenna and pick up unwanted noise

#### Coaxial Cable
- two conductors that share the same axis
- copper conductor transmits electronic signals
- layer of flexible plastic surrounds copper
- plastic is surrounded by woven copper braid or foil that acts as second wire and a shield for inner conductor
- cable covered with a cable jacket to prevent physical damage

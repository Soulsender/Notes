- does not use shielding
- **cancellation**
	- when two wires in a circuit are placed close together, their magnetic fields are opposite and cancel out each other and other EMI or RFI
- **varying twists per wire pair**
	- cabling must follow precise specs governing how many twists and braids are allowed per metre of cable
	- different coloured pairs twisted different number of times

#### Standards and Connectors
- conforms to standards established by TIA/EIA
- electrical characteristics defined by IEEE
	- placed into categories (5, 6, 6a, etc.) depending on bandwidth rates
- **Catagories**
	- Category 3 was originally used for voice communication over voice lines, but later used for data transmission.
	- Category 5 and 5e is used for data transmission. Category 5 supports 100Mbps and Category 5e supports 1000 Mbps
	- Category 6 has an added separator between each wire pair to support higher speeds. Category 6 supports up to 10 Gbps.
	- Category 7 also supports 10 Gbps.
	- Category 8 supports 40 Gbps.

#### Straight-through and Crossover UTP Cables
- ethernet straight-through
	- most common
	- used to interconnect host to switch and switch to router
	- both ends T568A or T568B
- ethernet crossover
	- used to interconnect switch to switch, host to host, and router to router
	- considered legacy; NICs use medium-dependant crossover to automatically detect cable type
	- one end T568A other end T568B

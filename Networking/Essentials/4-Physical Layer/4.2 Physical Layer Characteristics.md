- composed of 
	- fiber optic
	- copper cables
	- radio waves (wifi)

#### Organisations
- ISO
- ANSI/TIA
- ITU-T
- ANSI
- IEEE

#### Physical Components
- physical components
	- NIC
	- wireless cards
	- cable materials
	- ports and interfaces
- encoding
- signaling

#### Manchester Encoding
- represents bits based on voltage
- high to low voltage is a 0
- low to high voltage is a 1

#### Bandwidth
- capacity at which a medium can carry data
- measured in
	- kilobits
	- megabits
	- gigabits
- NOT the speed that bits travel
- the number of bits that are transmitted per second

#### Terminology
- latency
	- amount of time including delays
- throughput
	- measure of the transfer of bits across a media over a given period of time
	- slower than bandwidth
	- factors:
		- amount of traffic
		- type of traffic
		- latency created by device encountered on traffic route
- goodput
	- measure of usable data transferred over a given period of time
	- throughput minus traffic overhead
	- always lower than throughput

#### Module 7
- MAC addresses have to be globally unique
- ethernet is supported by 802.3 IEEE
#### Module 5
```
0xC9
C=12
12x16=192
192+9=201
0xC9 = 201
```
#### Module 4
- exchanging frames is part of data link layer
- **bandwidth is the capacity  at which a medium can carry data**
- **throughput is the measure of the transfer of bits over a period of time**
- **goodput is the measure of usable data transferred over a period of time**
